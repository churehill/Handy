Handy is an Android client allowing people use SMS instructions to controll remote Android devices. 

It can receive SMS instructions to make dial, send SMS, get GPS location, controll system (turn on/off camera flash just like torch app, change volume, change screen lightness etc), open applications, open url, set alarmclock, add/delete contacts and etc.

One typical usage scenario is that install Handy on old people's Android phones, then children of those old people can send SMS instruction to those phones, help their parents accomplish some   jobs, such as setting alarmclock and add contacts.
